     * save file. SKSE plugins can write their own data to this file, and load it again when the save game is loaded,

     * characters long (similar to the record names used by forms in ESP files). Note however this is little-endian, so
     * technically the 'SMPL' here ends up as 'LPMS' in the save file, unless we use a byte order swap.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>

     * for the entire plugin.
